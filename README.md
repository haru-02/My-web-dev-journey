# My-web-dev-journey
This is a collection of some small websites i made to practice web-dev.
I will keep adding more as i progress through.
I am following the course taught by colt steele in udemy. 
I followed the original course but halfway through, when i started with back-end he revamped the 
entire course with new concepts and other major changes. so there was a little setback.
however, these projects are fully functional.
